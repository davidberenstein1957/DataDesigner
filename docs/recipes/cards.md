# Use Case Recipes

Recipes are a collection of code examples that demonstrate how to use Data Designer to solve specific problems.
Each recipe is a self-contained example that can be run independently. They are designed to be a starting point for your own projects, and can be used as a reference for how to use the framework.

Looking for more pedagogical examples? Check out the [notebook tutorials](../../notebooks/README.md).
